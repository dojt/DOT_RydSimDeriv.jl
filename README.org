Derivatives for quantum simulations of arrays of Rydberg atoms.

Based on [[https://github.com/dojt/DOT_RydSim.jl][DOT_RydSim.jl]]


** TODO Tasks & Questions For Future Versions [1/2]

    + [X] =JET.jl=-testing is 💩 because all errors that occur in ~Base~ (!!) are excluded.

      - [X] There are currently no other tests....

    + [ ] Shift rules and whatnot have moved to package =Rydberg.jl=
      (in repo =Secret-ShiftRules=).  This means:

      - [ ] the functions in §4 of =src/DOT_RydSimDeriv.jl= are obsolete

      - [ ] ... the name of the package is kinda wrong....


** Version History

/Time goes up!/

*** *v0.4.0*  API BREAKING!  Moved to `𝛿𝑡ᵉᶠᶠ`-interface for evolutions


*** *v0.3.0*  New `𝛥𝑡()` function; `𝑡ᵒⁿ_𝑡ᵒᶠᶠₘᵢₙ𝛺`, `𝑡ᵒⁿ_𝑡ᵒᶠᶠₘᵢₙ𝛥` in `get_hw_data()`.

*** *v0.2.1*  New Policy: Evolution functions now return `NaN` in case of arithmetic errors.

*** *v0.2.0*  API-breaking: Now Evol-functions take `𝚷`-matrix instead of ϕ-vector

*** *v0.1.0*  Initial version
